# PIC18F47Q10 I2C Master Read/Write Data Using Interrupts

## Objective:
The PIC18F47Q10 configured in I2C Master Mode using the MSSP1 peripheral and performing read and write operations with interrupts. This example will use the slave [MCP23008](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21919e.pdf), an I/O expander, addressed in 7-bit mode.

## Hardware Configuration:

The PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano Development Board [(DM182029)](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM182029) is used as the test platform, along with the Curiosity Nano Base for Click Boards™ [(AC164162)](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/AC164162) and PICkit™ Serial I2C™ Demo Board [(PKSERIAL-I2C1)](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PKSERIAL-I2C1).

### MSSP1 configuration:
- Interrupt Driven
- I2C Master Mode
- I2C Clock Frequency: 100000

### Pin configuration:
- RB1 pin - digital, with internal pull-up, used as SCL
- RB2 pin - digital, with internal pull-up, used as SDA

## Demo:
PICkit™ Serial I2C™ Demo Board will be used to demonstrate this project. This board contains the slave [MCP23008](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21919e.pdf) with LEDs connected to all extended pins. 

The extended pins are set as digital output with an I2C write operation in the *IODIR* register. After the pins are set, the program will repeatedly:
- set pins to `DATA` value, with an I2C write operation in the *GPIO* register
- set `DATA` to the value read from the *GPIO* register, with an I2C read operation
- invert the bits in `DATA`

The initial value of `DATA` will be *0x0F*, and the program will continously toggle each half of the LEDs.
